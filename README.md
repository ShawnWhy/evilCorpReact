Manager of the Galaxy 

https://evilmanagershawn.herokuapp.com/

this is a one page app done with MERN, 

when the page opens, the user is automatically signed on 
as a manager.  

as a manager, the user has the ability to fire and hire people, as well as checking 
if a employee is a alien, robot, or just a human.

one can choose to login as anything other than a manager to see a different interface,
without alot of the options given to the manager

the user can use any of the employee names to login as that employee.
the password is always "password"
